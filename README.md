# ThirdPartyAPI-s-WorkDayScheduler

# Description 

This challenge was to create a calender application that allows the users to save events for each hour of the day by using jQuery, HTML and CSS. During this challenge the HTML and CSS were provided. The HTML has been shortened to what the original was to make it easier for other developers to interpret and it makes the code more clear and conscience. In addition when creating jQuery, the HTML had to be adjusted. The CSS was not adjusted, just linked with the HTML. 

The user wanted a daily planner that had standard work hours. The challenge did not say what 'standard' work hours are, therefore a 24 hour clock was created. This allows the user to input their work hours accordingly if they work shifts. Day JS was used to tell the user what day it was at the top, the day changes accordingly to make it more easier for the user. 

The time block of that hour is highlighed using CSS and JQ, so the user can see what time it is if they are looking at the schedule in a rush. Furthermore, there is colour codes to show past and present. 

Local storage was used in the code to enable the user to see what they have inputted previously, so it enables them to look at what they have planned. By using local storage, it saves the data that has been inserted by the user, even when the page has been refreshed.
